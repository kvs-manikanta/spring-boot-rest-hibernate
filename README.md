  <h1>CRM Application Using REST API, Spring Web, Hibernate, JPA</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application! This application is built using various technologies to provide a robust platform for managing customer data.</p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>REST API:</strong> RESTful APIs are used to expose endpoints for interacting with the application over HTTP.</li>
    <li><strong>Spring Web:</strong> Spring Web provides support for building web applications, including RESTful APIs, using Spring Framework.</li>
    <li><strong>Hibernate:</strong> Hibernate is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for mapping Java objects to database tables.</li>
    <li><strong>JPA (Java Persistence API):</strong> JPA is the standard interface for accessing relational databases in Java applications. It simplifies the management of database operations.</li>
    <li><strong>DAO (Data Access Object):</strong> DAO design pattern is employed to abstract and encapsulate the data access logic in the application.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Layer:</strong> Service classes are used to implement business logic and coordinate data access operations between DAOs and controllers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>

  <p>The project follows a standard structure with separate layers for data access, business logic, and presentation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Controller Layer:</strong> Contains classes responsible for handling HTTP requests, processing input data, and returning appropriate responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Layer:</strong> Implements business logic and orchestrates interactions between controllers and DAOs.</li>
    <li><strong>DAO Layer:</strong> Provides data access functionality, including CRUD operations and database interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Layer:</strong> Contains entity classes representing business objects and their relationships, mapped to database tables using JPA annotations.</li>
    <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Includes configuration files for Spring, Hibernate, and database settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed on your machine.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Running the Application</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Update the database configuration in the application properties or XML files, as per your database setup.</li>
